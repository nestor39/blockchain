# Blockchain

I decided to build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger allows partner banks to conduct financial transactions and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.


## Technologies

```
streamlit
dataclasses
typing
datetime
pandas
hashlib
```

## Installation Guide
In order to open and run this program you have to follow these steps:

* Go to my repository in GitHub and open the repository called ```blockchain_18```

* Copy the repository's link.

* Open Git Bash in your computer 

* Clone the repository by typing ```git clone``` and paste the link ```git@github.com:nestor39/blockchain_18.git``` :
```git clone git@github.com:nestor39/blockchain_18.git```

After clonning the repository, you  must type in Git Bash the following code line: ```Streamlit run pychain.py```, this code is going to direct you to a visual interface in streamlit in which you can see and test the code.
